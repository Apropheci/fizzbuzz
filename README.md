FizzBuzz written in BrainFuck.

This was made to work with the [BrainFuck Visualizer](http://fatiherikli.github.io/brainfuck-visualizer/). The larger the numbers the longer it will take.  
It may work in other interpreters/compilers, but I have only tested it with [this other one](http://esoteric.sange.fi/brainfuck/impl/interp/i.html).

I could have made it output the numbers as well, but the code would have been twice as long/slow(rough estimation).
